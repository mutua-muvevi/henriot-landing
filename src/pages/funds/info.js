		`Our absolute strategies yield returns uncorrelated to conventional asset classes. We use algorithms in our trade execution to help us trade the FX market efficiently. The use of algorithms eliminates human failings by providing a systematic and risk-disciplined approach in trade execution, optimizing speed and scale for the Fund.`,

This allows us to benefit from the various profit factors of the drivers and helps in diversifying our risk exposure and in regulating the overall drawdown.`,

By incorporating multiple diverse strategies into a portfolio, we are able to scale sustainably and deliver quality risk-adjusted returns for our clients.We believe this approach will enable a consistent and sustainable growth of capital in the long run and delivers the best client experience across market cycles.`,
