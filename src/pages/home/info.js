			`Market Amplification through Consistency, Discipline and Objectivity Quantitative trading is characterized by its consistency, discipline, and objectivity. `,
			`By using algorithms to process vast amounts of data, quantitative fund managers can make well-informed investment decisions in a systematic and repeatable manner.`,
			`This not only provides a higher level of confidence in the decision-making process, but it also allows for better market timing. With the ability to identify patterns before they become mainstream, a quantitative approach can lead to superior returns.`,

			Hunt for Positive Alpha
		`,
		paragraph: [
			`Henriot Investment Management differs from any typical fund by using extensive diversification through various different financial instruments and applying multiple completely different trading strategies. Thousands of different strategy variations catch trends, react to market waves, find repetitive patterns and seasonalities. `,
			`These strategies are used for more than 40 different futures contracts. Put together, they create numerous independent trading patterns. Currently more than 350 trading algorithms are used at once. They work on a daily to weekly basis. A single strategy will almost always suffer from periods of zero or negative returns. Having several hundred fundamentally different models in our portfolio allows us to compensate oneâ€™s losses with gains of other models.`,
			`Therefore, whole fund performance is almost always positive with more than 70% of positive months, which results in an almost steady performance. However, risk is not entirely eliminated.`

			Human can distinguish alpha from noise
		`,
		paragraph: [
			`Human intervention can effectively distinguish alpha from noise Machine learning and Algo trading models has the potential to help investors find alpha in unexpected places.`,
			`By analyzing financial data sets, machine learning models have in the past already identified the key performance factors that can increase the risk-reward ratio over time.`,
			`However, while machines have proven to be effective in amplifying market movements, it is crucial to have a human element involved and a clear understanding of how the algorithms are making decisions.`
