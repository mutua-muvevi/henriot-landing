					`In times of uncertainty, sticking to your long-term investment goals can be tough. But having a few wise words to live by can help you stay focused. Here are three of my favourite investment mantras:`,
					`"Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn't, pays it." – Albert Einstein`,
					`If you steadily grow your investments year after year, you'll see a significant boost to your personal balance sheet over time. For example, on the off chance that you start with $1,000 and develop it by 10% in a year, you'll have $1,100 - a $100 expansion in the worth of your speculation.`,
					`Assuming you acquire 10% the following year on that $1,100, your venture develops by $110. Over the long haul, you'll see your portfolio development add up. While it's improbable that you'll procure a similar rate profit from your ventures consistently, your general increases will grow over the long haul for however long you're acquiring a positive profit from normal.`,
					`So, it's wise to take a long-term view on investing and build a core investment portfolio that you believe will appreciate over time. Then, at that point, add as much cash as possible to it every month. Pay off any debt you have as quickly as you can as well.`,
					`"Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections than has been lost in the corrections themselves." – Peter Lynch`,
					`Market timing is a losing game. Assuming you sell your ventures, accepting that the market is slumping, you could repurchase at a more exorbitant cost. And if the market crashes again, you would be caught two steps behind. Assuming you have conviction in your speculations, utilizing market drops to add to them is likely better than selling them.`,
					`Investing legend Peter Lynch's Magellan Fund saw serious growth, averaging 29.2% a year between 1977 and 1990, despite the US stock market's fair share of brutal corrections– including a 35% drop in 1987.  Lynch comprehended that he could not time the market by attempting to foresee what might end up intriguing rates or the economy. In his book Beat `,
					`The Road, he expounded on possibly selling a venture on the off chance that its "basics break down, not on the grounds that the sky is falling." And data shows that Lynch was right – the Nasdaq's best-performing days happened during significant bear markets, not bull markets.`,
					`The numbers support Lynch's theories on market timing; if you had put $1,000 into the Nasdaq in 1971, it would now be worth $130,000. However, you would only have $26,000 if you had missed the 20 days when the index performed the best. Even more intriguing is that large bear markets, not bull markets, were many of Nasdaq's best-performing days.`,
					`"How many millionaires do you know who have become wealthy by investing in savings accounts? I rest my case." – Robert G. Allen`,
					`Although having cash set aside for high future costs is essential, an excessive amount of money close by can prompt what venture creator Robert G. Allen calls "cash drag." Holding too much cash, in the long run, means you'll have to deal with inflation. Regardless of whether the Fed gets back to its verifiable objective of 2% expansion each year, that is as yet a major thump on your buying control throughout the following 10, 20, or 30 years. To stay aware of expansion, you want to take speculation gambles, not simply to outperform it over the long haul.`,
					`Long-term inflation will be problematic if you have too much cash. Your purchasing power will be significantly reduced over the next 10, 20, or 30 years, even if the Fed returns to its historical target of 2 percent inflation annually. You must take financial risks if you want to keep up with inflation rather than outpace it over the long term.`,
					`The recipe for long-term investment success is relatively simple: pick a good mix of investments you believe will appreciate over time and consistently buy into those investments – for example, once a month. Tune out the short-term market noise and stay focused on your long-term investment goals.`,

					`The auto industry will expand over the next five years when measured in units, but it will contract when evaluated in enterprise value, per ARK's study. Global sales of light automobiles reached 78 million in 2021, and the value of the automotive industry as a whole was about $3.5 trillion. IHS Markit predicts that over the following five years, unit auto sales will rise at a compound annual growth rate of 4.7 per cent and reach a record high of 98 million units in 2026. The Non-Autonomous EV Base Case from ARK concurs with the general assumption that unit sales will rise by 20 million over the next five years. Still, it predicts that the enterprise value of international manufacturers will probably fall by about 20% to $2.8 trillion. As seen below, if autonomous taxi services were to take off as ARK's study predicts they would, car unit sales would likely fall by 8% to 72 million, reducing the enterprise value of conventional manufacturers by more than 60% to $1.3 trillion.`,
					`Unit sales have historically served as a reliable proxy for increases in the enterprise value of the global auto sector. As seen below, auto sales increased by about 5% in 2021 after dropping from 2017 to 2020, raising hopes that the industry's enterprise value would rebound and return to previous highs.`,
					`A shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and, albeit early, a shift from human-driven to autonomous vehicles are two major changes we believe the auto industry is currently undertaking that sever the relationship between unit sales and business value. The breakdown of auto sales by powertrain in 2021 revealed the difficulties non-Chinese automakers would face, given that 85–95 per cent of their revenue will come from gasoline-powered vehicles. While there was an increase in global vehicle sales of 5.1 per cent in 2021, only one-third of that growth—1.7 per cent—could be attributed to gas-powered cars, while the other two-thirds—112 per cent—could be assigned to electric cars. Global car sales did increase by 5.1 per cent in 2021, but as the graph below illustrates, only 112 per cent of that gain was attributable to electric vehicles, while 1.7 per cent was attributable to gas-powered vehicles. In other words, consumer preference for electric cars has gained traction. See below. In other words, consumer preference for electric cars has gained traction.`,
					`According to the consensus prediction, one hundred million units will be sold globally in 2026, 80 million of which will be powered by gas and 20 million by electricity. Gas-powered cars will grow at a compound annual rate of 1.7% and electric vehicles at a pace of 33% until 2026, respectively. The enterprise value of international automakers is projected to fall by 20%, from $3.5 trillion to $2.8 trillion in 2026, if current consensus projections hold.`,
					`If ARK's autonomous estimate is accurate, total vehicle sales are expected to decline by almost 8% over the next five years, from 78 million units in 2021 to 72 million in 2026. In addition, as illustrated below, 44 per cent of the 72 million vehicles are probably gas-powered, 26 per cent are electric, and 30 per cent are autonomous electric.`,
					`According to our estimations, today's $3.5 trillion in global automobile enterprise value appears to be discounting a significantly higher margin profile for the sector than it has seen in recent years. We think the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles won't likely result in a rising tide that lifts all boats. Instead, the sector appears to be in danger as producers of autonomous platforms squeeze out value at the price of margins for hardware makers. The industry still seems overvalued based on the rapid consumer preference shift toward electric vehicles at the expense of gas-powered vehicles, even if we are wrong and autonomous does not scale.`,
					`The auto industry serves as an excellent example of why active portfolio management will become increasingly important as innovation upends the status quo. The underperformance of established players can be hidden by disruptors, which can also produce value traps or stocks that are "cheap" for a cause.`,

					`It is now possible to trade stocks at a high rate of speed without the involvement of a human. High-frequency trading (HFT) allows for rapid changes in a security position using current technology and the consequent meager latency rates. High-frequency trading is an example of algorithmic trading (HFT). Automated or algorithmic trading occurs on computers.`,
					`To determine when and how to execute a real-time trade-in algorithm has been pre-programmed and compared to other market data gathered from other sources. In his book "Dark Pools and High-Frequency Trading for Dummies," Jay Vaananen (2015) explains HFT well.`,
					`American regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) attribute HFT with the following features. Orders are generated, routed, and executed using highly complex and rapid computer algorithms. Data streams from exchanges and centralized servers are used to reduce delays.`,
					`Maintaining extremely short deadlines for opening and closing positions, resulting in a quick turnover of a large number of minor posts in one or more financial instruments. Several orders have been submitted; however, they have all been canceled shortly after being introduced. Keeping a small number of overnight positions, if any at all.`,
					`HFT arose as a result of Sec's approval of electronic exchanges in 1998. HFT trades had an execution time of several seconds by 2001. By 2010, it had decreased to milliseconds, even microseconds – a millionth of a second, or a fraction of a second, or faster than the blink of an eye. HFT was a little-known phenomenon outside of the financial sector for a long time, but a July 2009 piece in The New York Times was pivotal in introducing the topic to a broader audience.`,

					`On a wide range of worldwide markets, high-frequency trading has become increasingly popular due to the expansion of independent, proprietary trading firms and quantitative hedge fund methods. High-frequency trading (HFT) has changed the global financial sector. A recent study indicates that HFT makes about half of all trading volume on US and EU marketplaces. Globally and across asset classes, high-frequency trading (HFT) has multiplied during the past few years. However, HFT's attraction is gradually spreading beyond stocks.`,
					`As a result, HFT should be permitted in financial markets under new restrictions to promote greater transparency and lower market volatility while keeping the benefits of algorithmic trading and reducing possible hazards.`,
					`Stock exchanges must not offer co-location, and all trades must be conducted at the same speed as the investor's exchange (IEX). The IEX was created as a direct response to Wall Street's unequal and murky trading practices, including paying for a competitive edge through co-location. The IEX aspires to make stock trading more transparent and accessible to the general public.`,
					`In mid-2014, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) began offering co-location to clients. Today, Hanna Ziady argues in a 2016 article: HFT: Co-location accounts for around 30% of the value exchanged in the cash equities market, which is far faster than previously assumed. An alternative view maintains that corporations will continue to gain from technological developments in the future, as high-frequency trading is seen as a natural stage in market growth.`,
					`To adopt HFT, Africa needs solid financial market legislation and infrastructure. With the arrival of 5G, Africa is left with limited options, necessitating to contemplate joining. Even though computers control about 80% of trades in South Africa, high-frequency trading (HFT) is still in its infancy. With African stock exchanges becoming more automated and regionally integrated, it's past time for them to investigate HFT seriously.`,

The study also discovered that algorithmic traders add to market liquidity. In times of low liquidity, and to a lesser extent during crisis periods, their contribution is much more significant. While HFT has many benefits, it also has its own set of obstacles. Since 2010, when the "May 6 Flash Crash" occurred 2010, HFT has come under fire. Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 600 points on May 6, 2010. This was known as the "May 6 Flash Crash." As a result, officials from all across the world have proposed legislation to limit current HFT operations. In a variety of ways, HFT has already had a significant impact on society and its investors. There is a positive and destructive impact.`,

Computing expert and inventor of complex trading algorithms, John Bates is concerned that his inventions could slip into the wrong hands in the early 2000s.

This is a must-read book for both traders and stock exchange regulators. Lewis claims that the market is "rigged" in favor of high-frequency traders in his book. In an article titled "Will high-frequency traders create market crashes?" Sasha Planting2015 claims that HFT has appeared out of nowhere. With the arrival of computerized trading in the 1970s, it began to evolve. By the 1980s, program trading between the S&P500equity and futures markets was commonplace. The JSE used electronic trading for the first time in 1996. Stock exchange floor "open outcry" was no more. Due to research that showed that algorithms might outperform human traders by 2001, algorithmic trading has gained much attention. Finally, given the growth of technology in financial markets, HFT is vital and should be permitted. However, to avoid potential hazards and misuse, their duties must be strictly regulated. Authorities claim that high-frequency trading (HFT) has become established in global market architecture.`,
